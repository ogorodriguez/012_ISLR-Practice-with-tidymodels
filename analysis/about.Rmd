This notebook will host the practice lab for the classic book [Introudction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
but now with an application of the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) principles.

This was created by [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/)

The purpose is to learn, practice and familiarize myself with the `tidymodels` suite
using case studies.
