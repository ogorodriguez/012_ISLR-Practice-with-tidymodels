# Introduction

This notebook will host the practice lab for the classic book [Introudction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
but now with an application of the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) principles.

This was created by [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/)

The purpose is to learn, practice and familiarize myself with the `tidymodels` suite
using case studies.

The author of the blog went through all the chapters of the book, [which is also 
available online](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf),  using the 
tidymodels packages in R.  

Also the book comes with an R package itself that hosts many of the data sets used 
in the examples:
